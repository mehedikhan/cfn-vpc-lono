# Lono CloudFormation Starter README

This folder contains the code that represents your infrastructure built with CloudFormation.

## Overview

The CloudFormations templates are generated by a tool called [lono](http://lono.cloud/).

## Updating the Infrastructure

The general steps to update the infrastructure:

1. Edit the files in this repo
2. Generate the CloudFormation templates
3. Update the stack with the changes

Steps 2-3 are automated with lono and performed together with:

```bash
lono cfn update STACK_NAME --iam --sure
```

## Generating the templates

If you would like to just generate the templates and not update the CloudFormation stack you can do so with:

```
lono generate
```

## Importing Templates

You can also get started quickly by importing other CloudFormration templates into lono.  For example:

```
lono import https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-west-2/EC2InstanceWithSecurityGroupSample.template --name ec2
```

After importing edit the generated param file in the `config/params/base` folder. Then you can launch the stack:

```
lono cfn create ec2
```

## More help

You can get help by adding `-h` to the end of commands.

```sh
lono cfn update -h
```

Help is also provided in the [Lono Docs](http://lono.cloud/docs/directory-structure/).
